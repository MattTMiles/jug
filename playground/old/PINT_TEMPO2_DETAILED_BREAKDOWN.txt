                     PINT vs TEMPO2: COMPLETE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

TOA #0 DETAILED BREAKDOWN:

TEMPO2 COMPUTATION:
  Input: Topocentric MJD = 58526.213889149
  
  Components:
    Roemer delay = -374.600 seconds
    Shapiro delay = +0.000 seconds
    "Other" component = +89.740 seconds (NOT documented in columns!)
    
  Formula: BAT = Topo + Roemer + Shapiro + Other
           BAT = Topo + (-374.600) + (0.000) + (+89.740)
           BAT = Topo - 284.860 seconds
           
  Output: BAT = 58526.210592 (284.86 seconds BEHIND topo)

PINT COMPUTATION:
  Input: Topocentric MJD = 58526.213889149 (SAME as Tempo2)
  
  Method: Unknown (not exposed in PINT's output)
  
  Output: TDB = 58526.214690 (69.19 seconds AHEAD of topo)

THE GAP:
  Tempo2 BAT is 284.86 seconds BEHIND topo
  PINT TDB is 69.19 seconds AHEAD of topo
  
  Total difference: 69.19 - (-284.86) = 354.05 seconds

================================================================================
                         THE CRITICAL DISCOVERY
================================================================================

Tempo2's "Roemer" column (-374.6 seconds) is NOT standard Roemer delay!

Standard Roemer delay should be:
  - Magnitude: ~0.5 seconds (light travel time for 150 million km)
  - Sign: POSITIVE (delay in going FROM observer TO barycenter)

But Tempo2 shows:
  - Magnitude: 374.6 seconds (750 times larger!)
  - Sign: NEGATIVE
  - Varies with orbital position (from -375 to -222 seconds)

This is NOT Roemer delay in the usual sense.
It appears to be some accumulated or derived quantity.

================================================================================
                           WHAT JUG WAS DOING
================================================================================

The notebook tried to:
  1. Use Tempo2's BAT directly
  2. Subtract "binary delay" from it
  3. Subtract "DM delay" from it
  4. Get "infinite-frequency time"

But this is WRONG because:
  - Tempo2's BAT already includes some delay interpretation
  - The -374.6 "Roemer" is not actually Roemer delay
  - There's a hidden +89.7 second component not documented
  - The entire framework assumes Tempo2's column labels are standard

PINT does something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT:
  - Computes from scratch using JPL ephemerides
  - Gets + 69.2 seconds total delay
  - Gives a completely different result (354 seconds off)

================================================================================
                              THE REAL ISSUE
================================================================================

Neither JUG's current approach nor simply "using PINT" will work because:

1. PINT and Tempo2 compute delays using FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT METHODS
   
2. We don't have the FORMULAS or UNDERSTANDING of what either is doing
   
3. The column labels in Tempo2 output are MISLEADING
   - What's labeled "Roemer" is not standard Roemer delay
   - There's a hidden component not documented

4. PINT doesn't expose its intermediate calculations
   - We only see the final TDB output
   - We don't know the component breakdown
   - We don't know the methodology

================================================================================
                          WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
================================================================================

BEFORE implementing JUG's own system:

1. GET PINT SOURCE CODE UNDERSTANDING
   - How does PINT compute delays?
   - What's the exact formula?
   - How is TDB derived from topocentric time?
   - What are the intermediate steps?

2. UNDERSTAND TEMPO2's COLUMNS
   - What does that -374.6 really mean?
   - What's the +89.7 component?
   - Is this documented anywhere?
   - Is Tempo2 using a different sign convention?

3. UNDERSTAND THE SIGN CONVENTION
   - Tempo2: negative delays (goes backward in time)
   - PINT: positive delays (goes forward in time)
   - Are these opposite conventions or different physics?

4. VALIDATE AGAINST REALITY
   - Which one matches actual pulsar observations?
   - Which is the "correct" time system?
   - Can we compute residuals with each and compare?

5. IMPLEMENT JUG'S PIPELINE
   - Once we understand BOTH systems
   - Choose which one to match
   - Implement the calculations step-by-step
   - Validate each component

================================================================================
                           SUMMARY
================================================================================

The 354-second discrepancy is NOT a simple bug or rounding error.
It represents a fundamental difference in HOW barycentric times are computed.

Solving this requires:
  ✓ Understanding PINT's algorithm
  ✓ Understanding Tempo2's algorithm  
  ✓ Choosing which to match
  ✓ Then implementing in JUG

We cannot proceed with implementation until we understand the underlying physics.
